### Hi, I'm Shawn.

I'm an undergrad at the University of North Texas, shooting for a B.S. in Computer Science in May 2019. I've designed and tinkered with programs as a hobby since I started writing my own [SRL] scripts in 2008, though the bulk of what I do these days is in C# and on the back end of various websites and apps.

I'm the developer of [discord.sh], a Discord webhook interface for Bash. I write scripts here and there for the Slack team from [/r/TexasRangers].

I'm an Eagle scout, class of 2010. I believe strongly in compassion, loyalty, teamwork, social justice, and altruism.

I raid for &lt;Blessed Blade&gt; on US-Fenris as [tank][Felweg], [DPS][Icyweg], and [heals][Jeff]. I'm also the guildmaster. We have two members, one of whom is my amazing significant other, who is way more into the game than I am.
